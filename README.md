This is a project by students at the University of Zurich, under the computer science faculty. Students at UZH are largely at the mercy of professors to provide learning materials, which often isn't enough. So, we took it upon ourselves to help out our fellow students (and totally not copy VIS and ETH which have had the common sense to do this ages ago, where it demonstrably works well and students are happy therewith)

If you're interested in running this locally, you must:
 - install postgresql (homebrew install if on mac)
 - get an [app password](https://knowledge.workspace.google.com/kb/how-to-create-app-passwords-000009237) from gmail (unsure about this steps for other mail services, but the project is configured to use gmail)
 - create your own secret key (not strictly necessary for local development)
 - install all dependencies (obviously)
